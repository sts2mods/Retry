// Snapshot the run's RunRngSet counters every time the player
// enters a new map point. Without this, retry from old runs is
// resource-faithful but the shared Shuffle / CombatCardSelection /
// etc. streams replay from counter=0, giving different opening
// hands. Snapshotting at the *start* of each room means a retry
// from that node restarts the run with the exact counter values
// the original combat saw.
//
// Hook: RunState.AddVisitedMapCoord is the choke point for "we just
// arrived at this coord". A Postfix gets us both the new coord and
// access to RunState (and thus RunRngSet).
